Please note that not all thought processes are my original ideas on this module. I have greatly benefited from
this Git repository: https://github.com/organicinternet/magento-configurable-simple/

This module works on a trick. When the product is loaded in Adminhtml, the product type is switched out to be configurable
type, when the page is in the catalog_product page. This allows all product editing actions to be carried out, just like
a configurable product.

In the future, we need to rethink the configurable panel as only one attribute is now presented on the frontend.
